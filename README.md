# DeepModelTrainer

[English](/README.md) | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](/readme/README_zh_CN.md)

DMT is a framework for training deep learning models. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy experimentation with different models, datasets, and training methods. DMT consists of four main components:

- configs:  YAML files to configure your experiments
- datasets: a sub package provides dataset interfaces
- models:   a sub package provides model interfaces
- trainers: a sub package provides container object to manage training and evaluating processes

## TODO

- [ ] fill the blank in [config format](/readme/configs.md/#configuration-file-format)

## Dependencies

DMT depends on the following libraries:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)
- [easydict](https://github.com/makinacorpus/easydict)
- [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)

## Usage

1. Prepare the datasets and models. See [datasets&models](#datasets--models) for details.
2. Prepare your specific trainer. See [trainers](#trainers) for details.
3. Write config files. See [configs](#configs) for details.
4. Launch the experiments. See [scripts](#scripts) for details.

## configs

YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages, which makes it a powerful tool for mapping configuration files to Python objects. We use

- YAML files to record the experiment configurations
- `EasyDict` to access the items in a (nested) dict as attributes

More details and examples can be found in [configs.md](readme/configs.md).

## datasets & models

`datasets` directory is a sub package providing dataset classes inherited from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. The dataset classes are instantiated by only one `args` or `configs` argument, and are used to load data from files and transform them into tensors.

`models` directory is a sub package providing model classes inherited from `torch.nn.Module`. Similarly, the model classes are also instantiated by only one `args` or `configs` argument, and are used to build the model architecture.

More details and examples can be found in [datasets&models.md](readme/datasets&models.md).

## trainers

`trainers` directory is a sub package providing container object to manage training, evaluating and sampling processes.
